# TUIKit_Android

English | [简体中文](README.cn.md)

## Overview

TUIKit_Android is a powerful UI component library built on top of Tencent Cloud's `AtomicXCore` SDK. `AtomicXCore` integrates the core capabilities of Tencent Cloud Real-Time Communication (TRTC), Instant Messaging (IM), Audio/Video Calling (TUICallEngine), and Room Management (TUIRoomEngine), providing a state-driven API design.

TUIKit_Android provides a set of pre-built user interfaces (UI) on top of the core capabilities offered by `AtomicXCore`, enabling you to quickly integrate video live streaming, voice chat rooms, audio/video calling, and other features into your Android applications without worrying about complex backend logic and state management.

## Features

TUIKit_Android provides complete UI implementations for the following core business scenarios based on `AtomicXCore`:

* **Video/Voice Live Streaming:**

    * **Live Room Management:** Fetch live room lists.
    * **Broadcasting & Watching:** Create live rooms, join live streams.
    * **Seat Management:** Support seat management, audience mic on/off.
    * **Host Co-hosting:** Support cross-room co-hosting between hosts.
    * **Host PK (Battle):** Support PK interactions between hosts.
    * **Interactive Features:**
        * **Gifts:** Support sending and receiving gifts.
        * **Likes:** Support live room likes.
        * **Barrage:** Support sending and receiving barrage messages.

* **Audio/Video Calling:**

    * **Basic Calling:** Support 1v1 and multi-party audio/video calls.
    * **Call Management:** Support answering, rejecting, and hanging up calls.
    * **Device Management:** Support camera and microphone control during calls.
    * **Call History:** Support querying and deleting call records.

* **Instant Messaging (Chat):**

    * **Conversation Management:** Support fetching and managing conversation lists.
    * **Message Sending/Receiving:** Support C2C (one-to-one) and Group chat scenarios, with multiple message types including text, images, voice, video, etc.
    * **Contact Management:** Support friend and blacklist management.
    * **Group Management:** Support group profile, group member, and group settings management.

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

* Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher
* Gradle 8.0 or higher

### 2. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/TUIKit_Android.git
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

`TUIKit_Android` depends on `AtomicXCore`, which in turn depends on `RTCRoomEngine`. The dependencies are managed through Gradle.

```bash
cd TUIKit_Android/application
# Open in Android Studio and sync project
```

### 4. Run Project

Open the project in Android Studio, configure your Tencent Cloud SDKAppID, UserID, and UserSig (usually configured in the `GenerateTestUserSig` file), then build and run.

## Architecture

The architecture design of `TUIKit_Android` follows layered principles:

1. **TUIKit_Android (UI Layer):**

    * Provides pre-built, reusable UI components.
    * Responsible for view presentation and user interaction.
    * Subscribes to `Store` in `AtomicXCore` to get state and update UI.
    * Calls `Store` methods in `AtomicXCore` to respond to user operations.

2. **AtomicXCore (Core Layer):**

    * **Stores:** (such as `LiveListStore`, `CallListStore`, `ConversationListStore`) responsible for managing business logic and state.
    * **Core Views:** (such as `LiveCoreView`, `ParticipantView`) provide UI-less view containers that drive video rendering.
    * **Engine Wrapper:** Encapsulates underlying `RTCRoomEngine`, `TUICallEngine`, and `IMSDK`, providing unified APIs.

3. **Tencent Cloud SDK (Engine Layer):**

    * `RTCRoomEngine` & `TUICallEngine`: Provide underlying real-time audio/video capabilities.
    * `IMSDK`: Provides instant messaging capabilities.
